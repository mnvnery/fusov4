                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Lothar Hempel was born in 1966. He lives and works in Cologne. He draws his inspiration from German history, Californian New Wave, Greek tragedy, pagan culture, music, and cinema. What matters to him is not the reference as such — taken for what it is or for what it conveys in today’s Western society — but a re-appropriation of these images and this reality to circulate within his individual universe, taking possession of them and thus creating a series of possibilities for specific interpretations by each individual person, in a journey between reality and dream.</p>

<p>The author of a small theater of the strange, Teun Hocks writes stories without plot and creates untitled paintings, allowing the viewer to freely interpret the meaning - or rather the nonsense - of the images presented to them. His physical omnipresence does not mean he is imposing. He gives us the possibility to inhabit his works, temporarily absenting himself from them, as in the video where he clings to a chandelier swinging back and forth endlessly, intermittently forced to leave the camera’s field of vision and that of our gaze.</p>

Through videos, installations, music, and dance, Perigot works to uncover the signs of the society of the spectacle. The territory of his works is situated in the turbulence of the interface between social space and the constitution of the singular self. Attuned to the reality of the world and its multiple manifestations in our society, he is constantly aware of the illusory mechanisms of identification: how do we let ourselves be seduced by celebrity? The models of representing reality, especially through video games, influence our behavior in our daily lives? Is it possible that we use the larger-than-life persona that we often assign to celebrities as a template for constructing our own identity?</p>

She studied classical dance in Madrid from the age of thirteen and embraced performance and contemporary dance in the mid-80s. She worked initially in Cannes with Rosella Hightower and then in Germany and New York. Upon returning to Madrid, she created her first piece in 1985, Carita de Ángel. The following year, she founded the Bocanada Danza group with Blanca Calvo, which dissolved in 1989. In the early 90s, she choreographed her first solo work, Socorro! Gloria!, which takes the form of a humorous cabaret show: thus La Ribot was born.</p>

                <p class="text-uppercase artist-name">Sofia Santa-Rita</p>
                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Sofia Santa-Rita, born in Lisbon in 1994, holds a degree in Communication Design (2017) and a master in Contemporary Typographic and Editorial Practices (2023) from FBAUL, with projects in the field of concrete poetry and video-poems. Defining herself as a multidisciplinary artist, she has a penchant for the paradoxical nature of things, focusing mainly on the image/text relationship, combining poetry, writing and lyrics with photography and video. Endowed with a very flagrant sensory aspect, her work is born from the need to fill the gap between herself and the other. The genesis and consequently the culmination of her work is found in the impetus to tell stories, finding in cinema her current focus and ultimate inspiration.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Gustavo Fernandes was born in the cradle of basalt on the Madeira Islands. The winds, Atlantic currents, and the embrace of the island of Pico all contributed to infuse life into him. Molded by the demands of computer engineering, he became a defector from formalism due to an innate hyperesthesia that led him to embrace less formal modes of expression, whether through writing, sound, or audiovisuals. As a promoter of the project ‘Ilhas à Escuta - Paisagens Sonoras dos Açores’ (Islands Listening – Soundscapes of the Azores), Fernandes writes for the magazine 9 Bairros (Azores 2027) and collaborates on the project ‘Rede de Memórias - As Mãos das Mulheres nesta Vivência de Ilhéu’ (Network of Memories - Women’s Hands in this Islander’s Experience). He is also a member of the team behind the publication Tramela Aberta, an initiative of the Corvo Vivo Association. However, despite it all, he remains simply an islander.</p>
