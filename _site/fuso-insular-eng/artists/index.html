As Atelineiras promote events, performances, workshops, exhibitions and collaborations with other artists, collectives and associations, which reflect the collective’s goal: to intervene and shake the Azorean cultural panorama. Their work is based on the development of individuality, with the goal of reaching a sustainable and progressive collectivity, questioning more and more what is around them, as well as the insular feeling that accompanies and sustains everything they do.</p>
