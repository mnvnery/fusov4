The artistic work of Driss Aroussi is polysemic, borrowing several lines of research, navigating between experimentation and documentary form. Driss Aroussi in his practice uses what allows to reproduce reality as photography, to grasp it as video. In recent years he has photographed construction sites, spending time with workers, sharing their daily lives, considering men, tools, objects and places. The real for him also bears the mark of work, the stigmata of its contradictions, the signs of the transformation that it operates on our reality.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Gustavo Fernandes was born in the cradle of basalt on the Madeira Islands. The winds, Atlantic currents, and the embrace of the island of Pico all contributed to infuse life into him. Molded by the demands of computer engineering, he became a defector from formalism due to an innate hyperesthesia that led him to embrace less formal modes of expression, whether through writing, sound, or audiovisuals. As a promoter of the project ‘Ilhas à Escuta - Paisagens Sonoras dos Açores’ (Islands Listening – Soundscapes of the Azores), Fernandes writes for the magazine 9 Bairros (Azores 2027) and collaborates on the project ‘Rede de Memórias - As Mãos das Mulheres nesta Vivência de Ilhéu’ (Network of Memories - Women’s Hands in this Islander’s Experience). He is also a member of the team behind the publication Tramela Aberta, an initiative of the Corvo Vivo Association. However, despite it all, he remains simply an islander.</p>

Examining how different technologies are interweaving these concepts producing/reproducing entangling structures between myth, fiction, and physical realities. Within such complex intersectional realms, the digital medium is emphasizing the shift in cognitive processes, oscillating the human experience and imagination between reality and hyperreality, human and non-human, physical and mental spaces.</p>

                <div class="artist-bio"><p>Adopting the tongue-in-cheek appellation Top Value Television, the influential video collective TVTV defined the radical video documentary movement of the 1970s that was known as “guerrilla television.” TVTV subverted conventions of television news and documentary reportage with its alternative journalistic techniques, countercultural principles and pioneering use of portable, low-tech video equipment.</p>

<p>With its roots in the Vietnam-era climate of political revolt, TVTV’s philosophy was articulated in founding member Michael Shamberg’s 1971 manifesto Guerrilla Television, a treatise that advocated video and public-access cable systems as tools of opposition and activism.</p>

<p>Guerrilla television was envisioned as a radical break from the ideology and technocratic control of broadcast television, a means to “demonstrate the potential of decentralized video technology.”</p>
