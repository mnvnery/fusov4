He draws his inspiration from German history, Californian New Wave, Greek tragedy, pagan culture, music, and cinema. What matters to him is not the reference as such — taken for what it is or for what it conveys in today’s Western society — but a re-appropriation of these images and this reality to circulate within his individual universe, taking possession of them and thus creating a series of possibilities for specific interpretations by each individual person, in a journey between reality and dream.</p>

<p>The author of a small theater of the strange, Teun Hocks writes stories without plot and creates untitled paintings, allowing the viewer to freely interpret the meaning - or rather the nonsense - of the images presented to them. His physical omnipresence does not mean he is imposing. He gives us the possibility to inhabit his works, temporarily absenting himself from them, as in the video where he clings to a chandelier swinging back and forth endlessly, intermittently forced to leave the camera’s field of vision and that of our gaze.</p>

Through videos, installations, music, and dance, Perigot works to uncover the signs of the society of the spectacle. The territory of his works is situated in the turbulence of the interface between social space and the constitution of the singular self. Attuned to the reality of the world and its multiple manifestations in our society, he is constantly aware of the illusory mechanisms of identification: how do we let ourselves be seduced by celebrity? The models of representing reality, especially through video games, influence our behavior in our daily lives? Is it possible that we use the larger-than-life persona that we often assign to celebrities as a template for constructing our own identity?</p>

The following year, she founded the Bocanada Danza group with Blanca Calvo, which dissolved in 1989. In the early 90s, she choreographed her first solo work, Socorro! Gloria!, which takes the form of a humorous cabaret show: thus La Ribot was born.</p>
