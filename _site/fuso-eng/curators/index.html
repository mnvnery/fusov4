Each curator is responsible for one of the screening sessions of the festival, and presents a selection of works chosen according to a proposed theme.</p>

<p>In addition to the curators, prominent people from the cultural area are also invited to promote a debate around video art and mediate a conversation with the curator before each session, in order to enrich the public’s knowledge.</p>

<p>The daily interaction of curators and artists during the festival week provides for the meeting and establishment of numerous partnerships, generating a network of connections and collaborations.</p>
