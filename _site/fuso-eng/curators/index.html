        <div class="me-md-5 curators-intro">Every year we invite Portuguese and international curators, who put together an exclusive program for FUSO. Each curator is responsible for one of the screening sessions of the festival, and presents a selection of works chosen according to a proposed theme. The sessions are preceded by a conversation between the curator and the moderator, in order to enrich the audience's knowledge. The daily interaction of curators and artists during the festival week provides for the meeting and establishment of numerous partnerships, generating a network of connections and collaborations.</div>

He lived part of his childhood in Niza, grew up in Barreiro, lives in Lisbon, feels like he is from the Alentejo.</p><p>Over the years, he’s been an actor, a DJ, a social scientist or a teacher. Now he is more into journalism, but does not practice impartiality and neutrality. Rather, he believes in choices, rigor, transparency, exhibiting plurality, analysis, questioning and the possibility, through culture, by mixing subjects, crossing languages, whether politics, economics, society, music, art and ideas.</p><p>He recently released the book <em>Não Dá Para Ficar Parado</em>, where music is the starting point, but only because it includes everything else.</p></div>
