I"Ò<p>The Moving Image Laboratory is a space/time dedicated to the creation of video works. The purpose of the residency program is to provide opportunities for people living in the Azoresâ€”whether they are artists or not â€”who have an interest in the cinematic arts, to realize their video projects by equipping them with content and references, and supporting them in the development and realization of their work. The reflection on the moving image is stimulated through theoretical and practical meetings, which establish the moving image as an artistic expression that bridges all practices, blending languages from experimental cinema, visual arts, performance, photography, literature, and digital media.</p>

<p>In this edition of the Moving Image Laboratory, director Catarina MourÃ£o was responsible for the theoretical component, while artist AndrÃ© Laranjinha provided technical support. During the Azorean summer, in weekly meetings, the participants â€” Ana LuÃ­sa Cabral, the Atelineiras collective, Catarina Fernandes, Maria Emanuel Albergaria, Maria JoÃ£o Sousa, Sandra Medeiros, and Willian da Fonseca â€” proposed ideas, created scripts, captured images and sounds, and ventured into editing islands, each telling their own story. Trying to avoid spoilers, so that the images and narratives create a surpriseâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>Ana Cabral</strong> invents an emotional inheritance in search of a past that she never lived;Â <br />
The <strong>Atelineiras</strong> - Bia, Carol, InÃªs and Xico, created an herbarium of autochthonous plants of the Azorean landscape to confront and question the notions of diversity in this flora;<br />
<strong>Catarina Fernandes</strong> offers us a gesture of love;<br />
<strong>Maria Emanuel Albergaria</strong> films seducing and compelling scenes that led her to a reflection on the importance of growing and caring;<br />
<strong>Maria JoÃ£o Sousa</strong> makes the invisible visible;<br />
<strong>Sandra Medeiros</strong> reflects on the traits we have and do not want to acknowledge;<br />
<strong>Willian Fonseca</strong> evokes his origins to address the situation of migrants.</p>

<p>Autobiographical or fictional, they trace a common denominator between the Azorean islands and cultures.</p>
