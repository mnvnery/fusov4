I"5<p>Filmed from the balcony of her home in Majdal Shams, Randa Maddahâ€™s film superimposes, through a complex device of mirrors, the two sides of the border that has divided the Golan Heights since the Six-Day War in 1967. Situated over the ceasefire line, Majdal Shams bears witness to this tragic separation and the deportation to Syria of the majority of the population, who have been forbidden to return to their land and visit their families. Thanks to the mirrors, the Israeli and Syrian military facilities are superimposed in the same shot. Populations on both sides of the border are subjected to the same oppression, sharing the same feelings of loss of identity and erasure of memory. For the artist, this is a fragmented vision of her fragmented self, in a beautiful landscape that she considers her own.</p>
