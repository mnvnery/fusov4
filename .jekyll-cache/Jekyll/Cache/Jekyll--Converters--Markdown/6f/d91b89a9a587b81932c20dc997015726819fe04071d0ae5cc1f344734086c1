I"Ì<p>Inspired by the diaries of an Egyptian oceanographer in the 1930s torn between his fascination with the West and his pride in his Oriental background, he was part of a British scientific expedition that took place on the first scientific research vessel in Egypt. The narrative imagines his thoughts regarding the collaboration with English scientists and his evolving relationship with the sea. Throughout the oceanographerâ€™s journey, he recalls historical events and memories reflecting the social and political struggles of that time, raising questions of nationalism and identity.</p>

<p>The video addresses the conflict of identity and envisions the dream of a nomadic land that the vessel resembles.</p>
