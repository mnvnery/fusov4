I"í<p>From the wet and dry landscapes - deserts, seas, rivers, and cities - tales of disappearance and appearance reveal the enduring relation of humans to their environment. Water in its diverse forms as the most important element for the survival of different living species, has long fascinated scientists, philosophers, storytellers, historians, writers who sought to give it a name, a consistency, a shape, to grasp its symbolism. Despite the fact, according to scientific evidence to be inexhaustible, it remains inevitably at the heart of the most significant contemporary environmental crises and political conflicts when approached from the anthropocentric perspective.</p>

<p>Here, some compiled images of Alexandriaâ€™s cisterns narrate collective dreams in Egypt that never came to fruition. There, another historical re-composition depicts the great flooding of the delta through the biblical prophecies of Nabi Daniel. Meanwhile, in an unfamiliar city devoid of human life, a plant experiences recurring dreams about a â€˜last observer.â€™ Further away, in the Moroccan desert, a man tirelessly excavates the earth to revive ancient water systems, emphasizing the significance of ancestral technologies for the communityâ€™s survival.</p>

<p>In a tapestry of narratives, a common thread surfaces: the intricate bond between myths and fates. The stories mirror humanityâ€™s resilience, adaptability and struggle in navigating survival amidst natural, social, and political challenges.They speak about events that took place in different times and places, perhaps simultaneously, uncovering the modalities of transmission and mythification of history passed down through oral tradition or projected on the screens of modern media.</p>

<p>The selection here presents, across various genres, the entanglement of history and myths, using archive material, found footage, recomposed images, and storytelling to generate new mythologies and imagery on water and its political and poetical representation. (Laila Hida)</p>
