I"<p>Recorded in the Javarí Reserve, in the extreme west of Amazonia, on the triple border of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, the work has as its theme the reversal of individual faith in religion, documenting the conversion currently practiced in an abusive way by the neo-Pentecostal churches, even in the last uncontacted indigenous region, inflicting as well severe consequences on the environment. </p>

<p>The process is ancient and has been repeated for centuries. Religious missions arrive, already financed by extractivism, succeeding each other in cycles… of rubber, gold, minerals, noble wood from the forest, wild fishing and hunting… always against the flow of the river, entering the Amazon, destabilizing the natural balance of the region and reducing until extermination the culture of the indigenous people, first inhabitants of these lands.</p>

<p>Faith is a power of each individual to relate to their existence, but religion emerges as a colonizing element of this faith, manifesting itself as a new territory and a new collective identity. The cataclysm that we see with the arrival of the missionaries is just the beginning of the loss of identity and the transformation of the indigenous culture into a new Christian context, unhealthy and miserable, which in fact borders madness.</p>
