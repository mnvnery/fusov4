I"<p>A love letter from the floor to the ceiling spelled out in stop-motion text, the video â€œDear Ceilingâ€ takes as its starting point the rejection of a human-centered vision of the world. Hoping to awaken the viewerâ€™s relationship to their built environment, the work is a playful invitation to reimagine the architecture around us as just as spiritually yearning and libidinous as we are.</p>
