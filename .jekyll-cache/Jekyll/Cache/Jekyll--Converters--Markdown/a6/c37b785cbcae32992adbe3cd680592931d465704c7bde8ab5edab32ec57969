<p>This programme presents the films selected and awarded in the FUSO Lisboa 2024 Open Call competition.</p>

<p>Having received over two hundred applications, FUSO’s Open Call 2024 in Lisbon confirms its uniqueness in the Portuguese panorama, as an open platform that welcomes all forms of moving images, without boundaries. A unique festival that brings together students and renowned artists. </p>

<p>It is by design that Fuso Lisboa 2024 proudly proclaims its spirit of “resistance.” More than ever, the selection process was difficult, arduous, and perhaps unfair. In this edition Fuso brings to the public twelve works evenly distributed between men and women. Their aim is to create an inventory – albeit fragmentary – of video art in Portugal.</p>

<p>The twelve participants were born between 1960 and 1995 and, according to the rules of the festival, they live and work in Portugal and/or are of Portuguese nationality. They have something more precious that unites them in this TIME ZONE: the will to capture the present.</p>
