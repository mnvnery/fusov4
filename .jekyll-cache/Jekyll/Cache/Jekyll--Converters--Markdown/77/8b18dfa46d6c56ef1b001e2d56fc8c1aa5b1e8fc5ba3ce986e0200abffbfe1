I"€<p>Mrs. Peanut Visits New York is a video portrait of the legendary late performance artist, fashion designer, and nightlife icon Leigh Bowery. Atlasâ€™ camera follows Bowery as he flamboyantly strolls through Manhattanâ€™s Meatpacking District, outrageously costumed in a self-made reinterpretation of â€œMr. Peanut,â€ the Planterâ€™s Peanut mascot. <br />
Boweryâ€™s molded full-bodysuit, accessorized with a floral print dress, top hat and transparent-heeled platform shoes, draws stares from onlookers. Peanut-related pop songs accompany him on the soundtrack.</p>

<p>Featuring: Leigh Bowery. <br />
Music Consultant: Scott Ewalt</p>
