I"p<p>Born in 1979 in Morocco, he lives and works in Marseille, France. The artistic work of Driss Aroussi is polysemic, borrowing several lines of research, navigating between experimentation and documentary form. Driss Aroussi in his practice uses what allows to reproduce reality as photography, to grasp it as video. In recent years he has photographed construction sites, spending time with workers, sharing their daily lives, considering men, tools, objects and places. The real for him also bears the mark of work, the stigmata of its contradictions, the signs of the transformation that it operates on our reality.</p>
