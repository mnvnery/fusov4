I"<p>The protagonist of The Mirror and the Dusk is a young man with a mirror under his arm. In the late afternoon, he climbs a hill in the Complexo do Alemão, a notorious favela conglomerate in the north of Rio de Janeiro. </p>

<p>The work is based on an experimental triple projection. One projection is replaced by a subsequent projection in a cycle, in which new images sprout up and interweave.<br />
The simple narration accompanied by a poetic minimal piano music invites us to contemplate and reflect. </p>

<p>Crossing the busy favela on narrow streets, through alleyways and up and down stairs becomes a journey of discovery in an area that is difficult to access and considered as a so-called dangerous non-go area. </p>

<p>The dynamic composition of the images creates a depth effect in combination with the sounds. The kaleidoscopic visual structure shows a complex settlement topography and social reality which we do not know.</p>

<p>At the end of the movie, the protagonist disappears, leaving behind the street lights.</p>
