I"<p>The Atelineiras collective built an herbarium dedicated to show the plants that the collective has been gathering in the Azorean landscape. Confronting the categorization of â€œinvasiveâ€ and â€œendemicâ€, they question these notions of diversity in flora, with the goal of showing that, like us, the Azores is also their home.</p>
