I"'<p>Ar.Co - Centro de Arte e Comunicação is proposing, for this year’s edition of</p>

<p>FUSO – Lisbon International video Art Festival, a selection of four works directed by students from the Cinema / Moving Image Course. These videos are like open maps that compose a cartography of unknown and intimate territories, using both georeferencing coordinates and sensory approaches to map affective spaces.</p>

<p>In Falha #72, by Ricardo Grelha, we are led by a voyeuristic gaze, lost in psychedelic delusions. In Boa Noite, Inês Falcão offers an expanded love letter dedicated to those who share with her the intimacy of surrendering to sleep. Uncomfortable Positions, by Frances Rocha, is a poetic journey through an archive of photographs of medical appointments; and Stephanie Kyek, in Mapping Blanca, leads us through a sound journey that (re)materializes the mapped landscape.</p>

<p>Most of these short films use images from found footage to transport us on their cinematic journey, a wild journey across clues preserved in multiple archives.</p>
