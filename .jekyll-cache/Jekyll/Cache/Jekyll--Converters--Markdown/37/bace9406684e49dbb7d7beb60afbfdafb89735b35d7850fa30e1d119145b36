I"Ç<p>Every year we invite Portuguese and international curators, who put together an exclusive program for FUSO. Each curator is responsible for one of the screening sessions of the festival, and presents a selection of works chosen according to a proposed theme.</p>

<p>In addition to the curators, prominent people from the cultural area are also invited to promote a debate around video art and mediate a conversation with the curator before each session, in order to enrich the publicâ€™s knowledge.</p>

<p>The daily interaction of curators and artists during the festival week provides for the meeting and establishment of numerous partnerships, generating a network of connections and collaborations.</p>
