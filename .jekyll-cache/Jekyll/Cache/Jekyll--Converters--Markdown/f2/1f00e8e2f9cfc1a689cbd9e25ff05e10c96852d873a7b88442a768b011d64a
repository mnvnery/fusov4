I"9<p>«The “<em>La mort</em>” in Prelude plays with “<em>L’art</em>.” (The moving images result from Bilbao’s manipulation of a scene from Jean-Luc Godard’s film Pierrot le Fou where “la rt” is transformed into “la mort.”). The end is only the prelude of what comes next. Bilbao’s circularity comes again into play. Working with DALL·E as a co-creator, Bilbao projects AI’s images and films the projection with a 16mm camera. The film is developed and edited analogically. After the final cut, Bilbao digitizes the images and sets up the installation. Media collapses into each other. Image recording technologies that appear to be reaching their limit (or “obsolete,” as some would say) are not only employed by Bilbao to question the materiality of the image; the artist also pairs these recording technologies with AI-produced images: la mort de l’image, the death of the image, takes us to the vital essence of its material life.» <br />
