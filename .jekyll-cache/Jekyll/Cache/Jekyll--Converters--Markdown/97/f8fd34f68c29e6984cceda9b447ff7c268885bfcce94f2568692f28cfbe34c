I"Y<p>After all human life disappeared from earth, a bored artificial intuition connects to non-human life. A plant is having a recurrent dream about a ‘last observer’. A dystopian narrative set in a speculative future tries to reconnect us to possible lost affects. All the components of the film take us on a journey through time. The pairing of the images of a speculative future shot with Super 8, a format from the past, creates a contemplative and rather endearing environment that throws us directly into reflections around artificial intelligence, anthropocentrism, and self projections.</p>
