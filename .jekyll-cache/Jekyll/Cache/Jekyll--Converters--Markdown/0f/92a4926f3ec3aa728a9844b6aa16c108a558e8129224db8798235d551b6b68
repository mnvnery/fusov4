I",	<p>Six years ago, FUSO dropped anchor on the island of São Miguel and created FUSO Insular - Azores Video Art Exhibition. This initiative arose as a direct response to address a notable void within the Azorean artistic panorama regarding training and knowledge in the field of the moving image. Among the activities developed within the FUSO Insular is the creative residency program called Laboratório Imagem em Movimento (Moving Image Laboratory) - a space/time for learning, research, and experimentation that takes place during the summer on the island of São Miguel. The Laboratory is open to people living in the Azores, whether they are artists or not, with the drive to create their own video work. The purpose is to provide content and references and support to the participants during the development and realization of their works.</p>

<p><strong>Azores Video Art Exhibition</strong><br />
Eight films that move between physical and emotional territories, with a poetic but also critical look at the society we live in, make up the Azores Video Art Exhibition. </p>

<p>The works were created last year during Fuso Insular’s residency programme – Moving Image Laboratory. <br />
For three months the participants - Anita Nemet, Carolina Rocha, Elliot Sheedy, Fernando Nunes, Gustavo Fernandes, Luís Brum, TAT and Tiago Correia - met with artists Daniel Blaufuks and André Laranjinha to jointly reflect on the moving image as an artistic expression that cuts across all practices. They wrote scripts, captured images and sounds, ventured into editing islands in search of how to tell a story, their story. <br />
And the result is films that move between the dream and the pain of war, the search for beauty in the contemporary world and self-knowledge, or an ode to a community in the form of visual poetry. </p>

<p>In this edition of the Azores Video Art Exhibition, we present a collection of narratives in videos that explore different languages - performance, dance, experimental cinema, photography, literature and digital arts - bringing the diversity of the Azorean art scene to their creations.</p>

<p><em>The Azorean Video Art Exhibition can be seen during FUSO week (August 28 to September 1) from 2pm to 6pm and on September 5, 6 and 7 from 4pm to 8pm at Duplacena 77 (Regueirão dos Anjos, 77 Lisboa).</em></p>
