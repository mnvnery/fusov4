I" <p>In this short story the viewer is confronted with a fixed image of a lonely old man, sitting on a small bench worn out by time. Holding a wooden stick in his right hand, hitting it against the dry land that belongs to him. This scenario echoes the passing of years and the wisdom of old age. The restlessness of the moment invites us to contemplate and reflect on a cause that seems lost to us: The Humanity.</p>
