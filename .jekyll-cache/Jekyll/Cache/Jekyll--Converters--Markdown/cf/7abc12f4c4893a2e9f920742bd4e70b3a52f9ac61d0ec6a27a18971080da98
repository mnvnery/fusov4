I"ë<p>Adopting the tongue-in-cheek appellation Top Value Television, the influential video collective TVTV defined the radical video documentary movement of the 1970s that was known as ‚Äúguerrilla television.‚Äù TVTV subverted conventions of television news and documentary reportage with its alternative journalistic techniques, countercultural principles and pioneering use of portable, low-tech video equipment.</p>

<p>With its roots in the Vietnam-era climate of political revolt, TVTV‚Äôs philosophy was articulated in founding member Michael Shamberg‚Äôs 1971 manifesto¬†Guerrilla Television,¬†a treatise that advocated video and public-access cable systems as tools of opposition and activism.</p>

<p>Guerrilla television was envisioned as a radical break from the ideology and technocratic control of broadcast television, a means to ‚Äúdemonstrate the potential of decentralized video technology.‚Äù</p>
