I" <p>Blue Studio: Five Segments is a groundbreaking work of videodance by legendary choreographer Merce Cunningham and Charles Atlas, who was the dance companyâ€™s filmmaker-in-residence from 1978 until 1983. In a series of short pieces choreographed specifically for the temporal and spatial characteristics native to video, and performed for the video camera, Cunninghamâ€™s gestures are multiplied, disembodied, overlayed and transported from the studio to a series of unexpected landscapes. The â€œBlue Studio refers to the color (â€œchroma key blueâ€™) that allows the dancers and objects to be â€œkeyed inâ€ to achieve radical manipulations and transformations of the video space. With image processing by Nam June Paik and a disjunctive audio collage that includes the voices of Jasper Johns and John Cage, Blue Studio is an iconic videodance that is â€œPart Oneâ€ of the equally iconic video Merce by Merce by Paik.</p>
