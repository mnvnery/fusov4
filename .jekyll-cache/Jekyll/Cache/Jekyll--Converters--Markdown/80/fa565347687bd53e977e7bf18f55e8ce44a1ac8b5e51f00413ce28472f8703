I"O<p>The Moving Image Laboratory is part of FUSO INSULAR, in co-production with Arquipélago - Contemporary Arts Center. It is aimed at the Azorean community interested in cinematographic art, with the objective of creating new video art works.</p>

<p><strong>Moving Image Laboratory 2023</strong></p>

<p>From July to September, participants have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge about the history of the moving image and create their own videos, under the guidance of artists with extensive experience in this field of work.</p>

<p>In 2023, Daniel Blaufuks and André Laranjinha are the invited tutors. At first, and based on his own work, Daniel Blaufuks is responsible for the theoretical component of the Laboratory, which will serve as a basis for the development of individual projects. Blaufuks uses mainly photography and video, presenting his work through books, installations and films. He has a predilection for issues such as the connection between time and space and the intersection between private and public memory. The practical orientation will be in charge of André Laranjinha, a visual artist who lives and works in São Miguel. Laranjinha has a degree in Fine Arts from the University of Lisbon and works in cinema, video, visual arts, graphic arts and illustration.</p>

<p>Participation in the Laboratory is free of charge and will take place at Arquipélago - Contemporary Arts Center, in Ribeira Grande.</p>
