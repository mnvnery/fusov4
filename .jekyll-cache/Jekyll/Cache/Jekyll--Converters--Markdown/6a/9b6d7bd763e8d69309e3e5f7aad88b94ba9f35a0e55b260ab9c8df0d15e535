I"®<p>Atlasâ€™ exuberantly hip homage to a specific time and place â€” New York, August 1983 â€” is a dance â€œhome movie,â€ a quasi-documentary that follows choreographer Karole Armitage and her dancers along the boardwalk of Coney Island and through the streets of Times Square.</p>

<p>Atlasâ€™ energetic hand-held camera finds dance in the visual cacophony of Coney Islandâ€™s flashy signs and swirling rides, and in Times Squareâ€™s neon blaze. He spontaneously choreographs the lights and rhythms of these â€œislandsâ€ to samba and punk-inspired music; the virtuosic editing is a dance in itself. Atlasâ€™ witty â€œdocu-narrativeâ€ format, Armitageâ€™s exhilarating choreography, and the vibrantly tacky visual milieu vigorously capture the garish, streetwise magic of a New York summer.</p>

<p>Choreography: Karole Armitage. <br />
Diretor of Photography: Paul Gibson. <br />
