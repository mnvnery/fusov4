I"Ð<p>Since 2012, as a visual artist, I have been focusing on various cultural and political issues affecting youth, concentrating on gender issues that reshape the identity of this generational community. I work through photography to capture the daily lives of young people and marginalized groups. My photography addresses difference as a political power and as an interface for full citizenship, challenging gender identity and exploring other ways of existing in difference that question and weaken the power of a binary and normative conception of gender. With the series New Age Kids, I have made young people from Lisbon, who do not identify with a normative gender, the object (and subject) of my photography.</p>
