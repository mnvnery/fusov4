I"≥<p>A camera placed on a border line: at the opening of this program, Randa Maddah, in her film In View, places her camera on a ceasefire line, a line of history which faces her home on the Golan Heights. She diffracts that line, projects it, and decomposes it in the mirror, creating various possibilities for perceiving a landscape linked to an occupation. The programme follows this stance, this time in Beirut. Basma al-Sharif‚Äôs The History of Milk and Honey interrogates the way of writing stories with history, images, invented narratives, and the way to share them. With Larissa Sansour, the history of Palestine turns into science fiction in Nation Estate. The program ends with Marwa Arsanios‚Äô Have You Ever Killed a Bear or Becoming Jamila, a film about a militant of the FLN (National Liberation Army, Algeria, 1954-1962), fighting for the decolonization of Algeria, and explores the iconic potential of historical figures, however controversial they may be.</p>

<p>The films were selected from the CNAP (Centre National des Arts Plastiques), that houses the national collection of the French Revolution. The CNAP collection has over one hundred thousand works, some of which are deposited in museums. The program was expanded to include new trends in contemporary art.</p>

<p>At the time when these films were being selected from the impressive collection of the CNAP, expressing support for the Palestinian people, denouncing the massacre of civilian populations, or calling for respect for international law, had consequences for many trade unionists, militants, and researchers in France, who were summoned by police or targeted by court proceedings for ‚Äúpromoting terrorism‚Äù. More than ever, works of art help us to think about history, discuss it, and put it into perspective in its immense and painful complexity. (Marie Voignier)</p>
