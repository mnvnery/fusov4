The new deities of our reality are the ones which we do not see â€“ and refuse to believe they exist. Our society scoffs at the religious fanatics of ourÂ ancestors:Â the Egyptian Gods, the ancient Greeks, the mythical dragon worshipers. The new pantheon of Gods that people worship are theÂ celebrities andÂ the beauty icons, who ubiquitouslyÂ glazeÂ all aspects of theÂ mediaÂ world â€“ this is the current form of human polytheism; contrarily, the contemporary form of monotheism practiced byÂ innumerable people is the act of self-glorification andÂ self-deism.</p>
