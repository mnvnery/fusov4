I"p<p>In the 52 years since the political protests at the 1972 Republican National Convention that were documented by the pioneering video collective TVTV, the U.S. finds itself once again in an eerily similar time of divisive upheaval, that renders the work both timely and prescient. It was the immediacy and intimacy of the small format Sony Portapak camera that radically shattered the rules of mass media programming, much as cell phone video and texts do today.</p>

<p>As the EAI catalogue states:<br />
The landmark documentary <em>Four More Years</em> is an iconoclastic view of the American electoral process, captured through TVTV’s irreverent, candid coverage of Richard Nixon’s 1972 presidential campaign and the Republican Convention in Miami. Using lightweight 1/2-inch portable video equipment, the TVTV crew was able to plunge onto the Convention floor for a close-up, subjective view of the proceedings. Whether soliciting off-the-cuff analyses from Dan Rather and Walter Cronkite, or making behind-the-scenes forays into the Nixon camp (with glimpses of the Young Republicans’ maneuverings, the Nixonettes, and a fundraiser with Tricia and Julie Nixon), the spontaneity and wit of TVTV’s coverage results in fascinating, unorthodox broadcast journalism. In this countercultural, Portapak successor to John McGinniss’ 1968 The Selling of the President, the well-oiled Nixon publicity machine is contrasted with the angry demonstrations of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. TVTV’s verite documentary is a classic work of guerrilla television, and an alternative time capsule of a volatile era in American history.</p>
