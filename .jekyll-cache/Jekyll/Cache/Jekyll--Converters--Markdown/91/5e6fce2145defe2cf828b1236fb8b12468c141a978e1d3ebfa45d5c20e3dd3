<p>VIDEO WINDOW (Zurich) as a guest at Fuso 2024, presents a programme entitled From Rio de Janeiro into Amazonia and beyond with three videoworks by the internationally renowned Brazilian-Swiss artists duo Dias &amp; Riedweg, based in Rio de Janeiro: Funk Staden (2007) and The Mirror and the Dusk (2011), followed by the latest one The Reverse of Heaven (2023).</p>

<p>The first two vídeos take place in Rio de Janeiro and its favelas, the third one leads us far from this city on the Atlantic and into the middle of Amazonia, to one of the largest indigenous territories in Brazil, the reserve in the Javari Valley on the triple border of Brazil, Peru and Colombia.</p>

<p>The programme covers a diverse and extensive range across both place and time: from an urban periphery context onto a vast territory of rainforest, and from the beginning of the colonial era to the present day. It poses many ongoing and difficult questions of global relevance, which go beyond Brazil. The works connect postcolonial urban realities, neo-colonialist claims and religious omnipotence, exploitation, exclusion and alienation, but it also brings to the forefront the importance of resistance, culture and subculture in the creation of identity and belonging. </p>

<p>Dias &amp; Riedweg artistic interests are focused on living environments, social mechanisms and power structures, keeping in mind the social margins and fringe groups. Another important reflection concerns the perception of the unknown other. The artists’ working method in video is based on in-depth observation and participatory actions with individuals and groups. The duo has been presenting their videoworks in exhibitions in the form of spatial multi-channel video installation.</p>

<p>The Reverse on Heaven was shown for the first time at DOBRA Festival International de Cinema Experimental in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (2023) and in the Galeria Vermelho, São Paulo (2024). Its international premiere took place at the end of May in Zurich, at the Videoex Festival (2024), and now at FUSO 2024 in Lisbon.</p>

<p>VIDEO WINDOW is a nomadic platform aimed at discursively transmitting contemporary video art in Switzerland and abroad. This is done in different ways and different formats, from single screenings and thematic series, to programs or exhibitions that are accompanied by talks with the artists. The platform has existed since 2012, and is led by the freelance curator and social and art historian Bruno Z’Graggen, from Zurich. <a href="https://brunozgraggen.ch">https://brunozgraggen.ch</a></p>
