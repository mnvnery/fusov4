I"Á<p>The landmark documentary Four More Years is an iconoclastic view of the American electoral process, captured through TVTVâ€™s irreverent, candid coverage of Richard Nixonâ€™s 1972 presidential campaign and the Republican Convention in Miami. Using lightweight 1/2-inch portable video equipment, the TVTV crew was able to plunge onto the Convention floor for a close-up, subjective view of the proceedings. Whether soliciting off-the-cuff analyses from Dan Rather and Walter Cronkite, or making behind-the-scenes forays into the Nixon camp (with glimpses of the Young Republicansâ€™ maneuverings, the Nixonettes, and a fundraiser with Tricia and Julie Nixon), the spontaneity and wit of TVTVâ€™s coverage results in fascinating, unorthodox broadcast journalism. In this countercultural, Portapak successor to John McGinnissâ€™ 1968 The Selling of the President, the well-oiled Nixon publicity machine is contrasted with the angry demonstrations of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. TVTVâ€™s verite documentary is a classic work of guerrilla television, and an alternative time capsule of a volatile era in American history.</p>
