I"<p>The Reverse of Heaven (2023) tells an essay-like story of neo-colonial exploitation deep inside the Amazon region in the Javari Reserve of indigenous at the triple border of Brazil, Peru and Colombia.</p>

<p>It artfully interweaves three spheres into a dense visual and acoustic composition: the vibrant, nature-loving and acutely endangered indigenous community and culture, rhythmically underpinned by wood knocking and heart beating drum sounds. The illegal timber industry on rivers, audible through the shrill sounds of saw blade grinding machines; and religion with the obtrusive proselytizing by evangelical independent churches with masses, litany-like sermons and church hymns promising paradise, up to the culmination in an animal sacrifice ritual by members of <em>Asociación Evangélica de la Misión Israelita del Nuevo Pacto Universal</em>, a religious movement originally based in Peru who settled from the Altiplano in the Javari River basin in the 1990s and adheres to strict interpretation of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>In the end, the film shows the importance and power of religion in the centuries-long colonization process as legitimacy and catalyser. The conquest of territories is closely linked to the conquest and transformation of mental territories and souls.</p>
