I"Í<p>The Geomorphosis Cycle is an anthology looking into the intersection between water technologies and mythologies through simulation, science-fiction and poetry. In the Mediterranean, coastal cities are increasingly threatened by being swallowed by a rising sea, while inland ones face the risk of drowning under the waves of sand of an expanding desert. Between the polarised narratives of â€œsubmergence and droughtâ€, governments in the region are beginning to use the latest technologies and top-down modes of governance for a â€˜futuristic cityâ€™.Â </p>

<p>Spanning from Alexandria to Marrakech, The Geomorphosis Cycle explores the politics of human-made water crises in the region, while speculating about urban transformations in a post-anthropocene and more-than-human world. Surrounded by randomised sounds of wrestling winds and tempestuous seas, the two videos respectively combine the dissonant footage of flooding on the Egyptian coastline of Alexandria, with conditions of increasing drought in the in-lands terrains of the Marrakech palmgrove.Â </p>

<p>Biblical passages from Daniel for Alexandriaâ€™s sequences respond to the poetic verses by Ibrahim Al-Koni from his book â€œThe Land And The Seaâ€™â€™.</p>
