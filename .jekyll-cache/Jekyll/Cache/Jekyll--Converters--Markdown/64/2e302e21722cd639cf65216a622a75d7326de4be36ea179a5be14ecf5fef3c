I"ù<p>Atelineiras is a transdisciplinary collective formed in 2020, in S√£o Miguel, Azores, consisting of Beatriz Toste, Carolina Amado, In√™s Falc√£o and Xico Xico.¬†¬†</p>

<p>Within this collective, they seek to consolidate artistic structures informed by their own perspectives on collectivity, the approach to audiences and the free experimentation of artistic techniques that accompany the progress of each member of the collective. As Atelineiras promote events, performances, workshops, exhibitions and collaborations with other artists, collectives and associations, which reflect the collective‚Äôs goal: to intervene and shake the Azorean cultural panorama. Their work is based on the development of individuality, with the goal of reaching a sustainable and progressive collectivity, questioning more and more what is around them, as well as the insular feeling that accompanies and sustains everything they do.</p>
