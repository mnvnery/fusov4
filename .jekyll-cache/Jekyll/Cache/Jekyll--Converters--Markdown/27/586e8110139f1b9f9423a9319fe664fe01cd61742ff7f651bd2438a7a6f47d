I"–<p>A reflection on concrete poetry in which the letter is the protagonist, this experimental film explores the boundaries between poetry and cinema. â€œThe letterâ€ always provokes a connection arising from its familiarity. Even if not immediately â€œreadableâ€ it is recognizable. Thus, these verses, displayed in three chapters (displaced, disentangled and unveiled) follows nightdresses that have been in the same family for several generations. The word text, derived from Latin texts that means fabric, contains in its genesis a clue to this story, which is woven, using the evening costume as a catalyst for contemplation around intimacy and memory.</p>
