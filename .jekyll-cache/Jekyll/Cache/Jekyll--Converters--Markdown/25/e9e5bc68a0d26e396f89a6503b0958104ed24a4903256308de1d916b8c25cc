I"Ş	<p>The Moving Image Laboratory is part of FUSO INSULAR, in coproduction with ArquipÃ©lago - Contemporary Arts Center.Â </p>

<p>It is aimed at the Azorean community interested in cinematographic art, with the objective of creating new video art works. An â€˜Open Callâ€™ encourages people to apply for the Residency Program, which lasts for three months and takes place on the island of SÃ£o Miguel. A jury composed by members of the local art scene selects up to 8 participants, who receive theoretical training and practical tutoring throughout the Laboratory period.</p>

The Moving Image Laboratory 2023</strong></p>

<p>From July to September, eight participants â€“ Anita Nemet, Carolina Rocha, Elliot Sheedy, Fernando Nunes, Gustavo Fernandes, LuiÌs P Brum, TAT and Tiago Correia had the opportunity to deepen their knowledge about the history of the moving image and create their own videos, under the guidance of artists Daniel Blaufuks and AndrÃ© Laranjinha.</p>

<p>Portuguese photographer and filmmaker, PhD from the University of Wales and with extensive experience in teaching, Blaufuks started from the analysis of the history of the moving image and then of his own work as a basis for the development of individual projects.</p>

<p>AndrÃ© Laranjinha, a visual artist who lives and works in SÃ£o Miguel, was in charge of the practical orientation. Laranjinha has a degree in Fine Arts from the University of Lisbon and works in cinema, video, visual arts, graphic arts and illustration.</p>

<p>Participation in the Laboratory is free of charge, with the technical support of ArquipÃ©lago - Contemporary Arts Center, where the residency program and the screenings of the videos takes place.</p>
