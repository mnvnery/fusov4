The award-winning video furthers Anamary Bilbao‚Äôs work from its more well-known visual arts dimension to one that reveals a para-narrativity already inferred from her previous work. Caricature-like and diabolic characters ‚Äî a kind of red goblins ‚Äî are the protagonists in small scenes that, like the interludes of medieval theatre, articulate more abstract moments (true exercises in colour and light) with fragmentary registrations of a still life that is never perceived in its entirety. Degraded by filters and scratches of colour, the image as a whole becomes a territory of restlessness where the survival of the very idea of representation is challenged. The interplay between the images and the soundtrack, particularly through the use of voice and text, adds precision and dynamism to the work. This also imparts a sense of solemnity at its conclusion, making the work a testament to the loss of that reality, as well as a confession of that loss.</p>

<p>Although the Honorable Mention is not an official category in the statutes of FUSO and does not confer any type of diploma, we want to highlight another work in competition: <em>Run, Snail, Run</em> by Jo√£o Francisco Correia. This piece stands out for the creativity shown in its narrative construction and the visual solutions employed.</p>
