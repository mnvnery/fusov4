I"­<p>In Lisbon, the sound of an immigrantâ€™s boots hitting the Portuguese cobblestone sidewalk echoes like a metronome, of fear and hope. <em>CanÃ§Ã£o de Ninar</em> is an ode to longing, a song to the pain of departure and the joy of remembrance. The film, with original soundtrack and images generated by Artificial Intelligence, addresses the struggle and resilience of those who move forward, guided by the sirenâ€™s song.</p>
