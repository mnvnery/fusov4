I"n<p>Resistance is the theme of this year’s FUSO. Life, in its beauty and complexity, is an act of resistance that permeates the animal and the plant realms. Life is not a life if is detached from the capacity to resist which, on a more elementary level, we can understand as simply being alive. But for us, human beings, being alive is not enough. It cannot be enough. As we are, we want to be able to contribute to something better for all of us. But it is not just with words that this process unfolds. In reality, it is through ideas and actions. At this moment in time none of our belligerent world leaders claims to be pro-war. On the contrary. And another important topic of our time, sustainability, should be seen as ‘not doing’ or ‘doing less’: less fashion industry, less travel, fewer events—especially in green parks, which are growing in number—less noise and more awareness. Similarly, our patriarchal society, our racist and xenophobic society, also claims not to be so. In this context, there is a double need for resistance, which makes everything even more complex: resistance against the aggressor, against those who disrespect or distort life at all levels; and resistance against perverse subversion, which in fact contributes to this degradation. Thought and art will always be, in their own way, fundamental weapons. Thankfully.  (Isabel Nogueira)</p>
